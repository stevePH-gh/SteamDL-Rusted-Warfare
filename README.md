# Rusted Warfare SteamDL

## A portable mod downloader

I created this project for only downloading Rusted Warfare mods from **SteamWorkshop**.  
**NOTES:** I have no plans developing a mobile app (*yet*)

### **Support:**
This program only supports Windows x64  
Two files are available to download:  
| Version | Requirements | Size |
|---------|-------------|------|
| protoype2 | Download and run, no further setup needed | 150MB |
| portable      | May require .NET Framework 8.0 | 220KB |

### **Installation:**
This program needs SteamCMD to work.  


**1**. Download steamcmd.zip  
**2**. Create a "steamcmd" folder on your desktop  
**3**. Extract "steamcmd.exe"  
**4**. Place "steamcmd.exe" inside "steamcmd" folder.  
**5**. Download mod files...

If you have issues or problems with the program, feel free to send your feedback!
